My name is Victor, although some people know me as 20 (Vinte / ***ˈvĩ.t͡ʃi***, the Portuguese way to say the number). My pronouns are ***he***/***him***. I graduated as a Bachelor in Economics at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, and I am also a data developer since 2020, having worked both as a data analyst and data engineer. I am able to develop in some languages such as **R**, **Julia**, **SQL**, **Python**; and I am also comfortable with some skills which include **cloud computing**, **IaC**, **spreadsheets** and **data viz**.  

🧩 I am very interested in contributing with the open source community, as well as integrating with people of color in tech.

🌐 I used to upload my early steps in data at [my Kaggle profile](https://kaggle.com/victorcvriano), but my latest stuff is uploaded right here. You can reach me by [email](mailto:victorcvriano@gmail.com), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/victorcvriano) or [Polywork](poly.work/victorcvriano).

🎧 By the way, I am also very interested in videogames and music. Talking about the later, I am always updating my playlists on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/victorcvriano). Sometimes I also upload some beats and setlists in [my Soundcloud page](https://soundcloud.com/20do100tro).
